## 5th-October-2016 Beta 16

Lots of improvements for this release, and more to come !

![](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/teechart_worldseries_3d.png)


- Delphi 10.1 Starter Edition support

  Support for the [free Delphi 10.1 Starter edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/es/products/delphi/starter/promotional-download)

  Note: Packages must be manually compiled in the Delphi IDE because "Starter" does not provide command-line compilation. Run TeeBIRecompile.exe tool to generate the appropiate packages and follow the instructions. 

- Geo Database


![](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/geo_database.png)

 * The Geo database (located in "Sample Data" folder) now contains many more tables with data from several countries (like provinces of France, Prefectures of Japan, etc, etc). These tables can be used to perform query aggregations at several levels eg: "group by Germany.Lands" with just setting your custom data "Master" property to its equivalent field in Geo tables, like:
 
 ```delphi
 uses BI.Data.Geographic;
 MyData['FIPS'].Master := TGeo.Entities.USA.Counties.ID;
 // "MyData" can now be used in queries that use TGeo data, like: 
 //  sum(MyData.Value) group by Geo.Entities.USA.State
 ```
 
 Another use of Geo tables is BIChart control will automatically detect which map corresponds to a data or query to fill the map polygons with the data values, at the selected levels (continents, countries, regions, provinces / counties and so on)
 
 ```delphi
 BIChart1.Data := MyData;
 ```

![](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/geo_chart_custom_polygons.png)

- BIChart control

 * Many refactoring changes in BIChart. Code is now split into several different units, one for each special chart style:
 
 * BI.VCL(fmx).Chart.Financial for stock / candle OHLC charts
 * BI.VCL(fmx).Chart.Three3D for surface, contouring, 3D grid xyz charts
 * BI.VCL(fmx).Chart.Geo for geographic world maps
 
 * Another new unit BI.VCL(fmx).Chart.Plugin implements the link with TeeChart. 
 The final goal is BI.Chart unit by default not using TeeChart directly.
 
 * Geographic charts have been the most improved kind, capable of linking directly to TGeo database to automatically recognize data links to countries, provinces, regions, etc to fill the appropiate polygons.
 
 * Several new features in TeeChart TWorldSeries are also used by BIChart when present. The latest TeeChart Pro build (build 161005 or greater) is required. 
 
![](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/geo_chart_usa_counties_and_state_boundaries.png)
   
 
- More sample data

 * "Sample Data" folder contains a new native TeeBI file with a table imported from a Excel file with USA by County "education" levels from 1970 to 2014.  This table is used to test BIChart control filling the USA map county by county, with year by year optional animation.

- Custom Data at design-time

 * TDataDefinition component has a new style: "Custom" to enable creating data structures at design-time just double-clicking the component to show the editor dialog where we can add or remove children items and manually entering data values. Data is saved into the DFM / FMX form file.  This can be useful for simple small data tables that should participate in queries or used in charts at design-time without needing to store them on disk
  
- Summary Aggregations

 * Two new TAggregate values: "First" and "Last" allow creating group-by queries to return not only numeric values (sum, max, min, average, count), but also the first or last ocurrences of all values of a given group, being them numeric or not (text, etc)
 
 ```delphi
 // Show Name of first Person ocurrence for each Department
 BIQuery.Measures.Add( Persons['Name'], TAggregate.First );
 BIQuery.Dimensions.Add( Persons['Department'] );
 ```
 
- Data Gridify

 * New TGridify class (BI.Data.Gridify unit) enables creating a "grid" from a "flat" table:
 
   Example:

```delphi
  BIGrid2.Data:= TGridify.From(BIGrid1.Data, 'Happiness', 'Year', 'Person')

  From this BIGrid1.Data original data:

  -----------------------
  Year  Person Happiness

  2016  Alice    21
  2016  Bob      14
  2016  Mike     39
  2017  Bob      65
  2017  Mike     80
  2018  Alice     3
  2018  Bob       9
  2018  Mike      4

  Output is:

  -----------------------
         Happiness
  Year   Person
         Alice Bob Mike

  2016    21    14   39
  2017          65   80
  2018     3     9    4
  -----------------------
```
 
![](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/TeeBI_Gridify.png)
 
- Data Rankings

 * New class TDataRank (at BI.Data.Rank unit) with a simple single method, to create a new column with "rankings" (eg: 1st, 2nd, 3rd..., etc) from any column values, grouped by zero or more fields, in ascending or descending order. This feature is more or less equivalent to SQL "rank over partition"
 
```delphi
  MyTable.Items.Add( TDataRank.From( MyTable, MyTable['By Year'], MyTable['Some Value'] );
```

![](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/Data_Rankings.png)

- Demos

 * [Expression test](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/firemonkey/Expressions) example has a new improved benchmark code, for both parsing and evaluating expressions.
 
 * [Speed test](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/firemonkey/Speed) is now available for both Firemonkey and VCL
 
 * New [Custom Expressions](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/vcl/Expressions/Custom_Function_Expressions) example shows how easy it is to create a new custom function that can be then used in many places, like for example in SQL query expressions (select, where, group by, order), TExpression.Evaluate('myfunction(params...)') and BIQuery filter properties
 
 * New [Filtering example](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/vcl/Filter/BIGrid_Filter) showing usage of the low-level data filter classes. These classes are internally used by high-level BIQuery component and its visual editor dialogs
 
 * New [BIGrid](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/vcl/Grid/Basic) simple examples
 
 * New [Gridify example](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/vcl/Grid/Gridify) shows TGridify and TDataRank classes in action
 
 * [Import demo](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/demos/delphi/vcl/Import/Import_ByCode.pas) has a new tab to show importing data from an HTML table tag
 
 * New [TDataRank example](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/vcl/Query/Ranks) offers several combinations to create "rankings" on data values or expressions
 
 * New [TDataSelect example](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/vcl/Query/Select_Queries) contains several examples of low-level use of the TDataSelect class to perform "select" queries that do not involve summarization or aggregations. TDataSelect and TSummary classes are used at high-level TBIQuery component for design-time visual no-code query / pivot-table features
 
- Data Compression

 * New BI.Data.Compression unit implements a TCompression class with methods to compress and decompress TStreams. This class uses by default the system Zip class, and it provides a "Plugin" property to choose a different alternative compression engine: TCompression.Plugin := TSynZipCompression.
 
   Two units are provided with compression engines for SynZip and Snappy.
   
- Data Export

 * New Export Data dialog (VCL only, FMX soon) to copy to clipboard or to save to a file data contents in all available formats (CSV, JSON, XML, HTML, Excel, PDF, native, etc).  This dialog is accessible by code or visually in the BIGrid top-left menu
 
- TRichView support 

  [www.TRichView.com](http://www.TRichView.com)

 * New unit BI.VCL.Export.RichView includes a small TDataRichView class with methods to Add any TDataItem to a TRichView control
 
 
- Other

 * New methods in TDataClone class (BI.DataSource unit) to clone just the structure of a TDataItem (including sub-tables recursively), and to clone just the data (eg: copy the data from a TDataItem to another, provided they have the same structure)
 
 * New TDataCursor.ToData function uses TDataClone new methods to return the output of a cursor, including cursor sorting, filtering, row selection (from row ... to row), and Items selection (eg: just some items, not all items)
 
 * New FloatFormat property in base class TBITextExport enables custom formatting for float data (single, double, extended) in all descendant classes (CSV, JSON, XML, HTML and PDF)
 
 * New FromEqual and ToEqual boolean properties in TDateTimeFilter class (BI.Expression.Filter unit) to determine if the filter From and To properties include "equal" or not. ( > versus >= ,  < versus <= )
 
 * New TParameterExpression abstract class (in BI.Expression unit) can be used to derive custom expression functions that require parameters
 
 * New Abs and Sign functions supported in TMathExpression  (eg: TExpression.Evaluate('Abs(-123)') returns 123)
 
 * New BI.Arrays.Strings unit contains a simple TStringArray type and helper methods
 
 * New TCommonUI IsURL function, returns True when parameter begins with http:// or https://
 
 * New TClientDatasetExport class (in BI.Data.ClientDataset unit) to export any TDataItem to a TClientDataset
 
 * New TDataKindConvert methods (in BI.Data.Convert unit) enables switching the Kind of a TDataItem (eg: from Text to Integer) by converting all data from one kind to another. A "CanConvert" boolean function returns True if the conversion will succeed. This is specially important when converting from for example text to numbers, to detect incompatible texts with no numbers.
 
 * TBIDataset string fields are now "ftWideString" instead of "ftString", to support Unicode character encoding
 
 * Fixes for RAD Studio XE5 (some units could not be compiled)
 
 * Optimizations in "THops" class to reduce the number of steps when executing queries involving complex relationships (ie: "query plan" redundancy elimination)

 * BIGrid now detects changes in its source data to refresh the grid cells in a more optimized manner (without re-creating the grid columns)

 * TDataItem now issues broadcasts when adding, removing, exchanging or renaming child Items, for listeners (eg: BIGrid) to refresh their contents
 
 * TBIWebClient class (BI.Web unit) now uses the new TCompression class for compressing and decompressing web streams (for example when used in BIWeb server). TCompression can specify a custom "plugin" engine library to replace the default System.Zip
 
 * Several changes to improve FreePascal / Lazarus compatibility (removed some "anonymous methods")
 

## 3rd-August-2016 Beta 15

- TBIDataset

 * Fixed master-detail BIDataset relationships when the key consists of multiple fields
 
- Arrays

 * New BI.Arrays.Parallel.pas unit, includes methods to perform multi-cpu sorting of arrays using threads using TTask. For example sorting a 50 million integer array takes aprox 2 seconds instead of 5 on an i7 machine:
 
 ```delphi
 uses BI.Arrays, BI.Arrays.Parallel;
 var MyArray : TInt32Array;  MyArray.Resize(50000000); ...fill array...
   // optional parameters: Ascending (default True), Threads (default 0=auto)
   MyArray := TParallelArray.Sort(MyArray);
 ```
 
 * New TSorted(Ascending/Descending)Array methods to "merge" sorted arrays. Return one array from multiple ones, with all elements sorted:
 
 ```delphi
 uses BI.Arrays, BI.Arrays.Parallel;
 var A,B,C : TSingleArray; ... A.Sort; B.Sort;
   C := TSortedAscendingArray.Merge(A,B);
 ```
 
 * New "Equals" method in BI Arrays, return True when the arrays are identical:
 
  ```delphi
  uses BI.Arrays;
  var A,B: TInt64Array; ...
  if A.Equals(B) then ...
  ```

 * Speed improvements in QuickSort algorithm, now using an "hybrid" approach using InsertionSort to order small portions (16 items or less).  This gives aprox 20% better speed in most cases.
 
- Examples

  * New example using the Wikipedia api to search topics, retrieve html tables from result pages, and importing them into TDataItem objects to present in grids, charts, make queries, etc
  
  * New example of a custom TDataProvider class at BI.Data.Process.pas unit, TProcessList maintains a list of running processes with per-process information (ID, Name, Workingset, etc).  BIGrid1.Provider:=TProcessList.Create(Self)
  

- TExpression

  * Support for multiple parameters in expression functions, for example: "SubString('Hello',5,3)"
  
  * New expression class TTextOperandExpression, with functions: "IndexOf", "Pad", "Split", "Insert", "Remove", "Replace", "Count"  and "SubString"
  
  * New TArrayExpression class, includes an Items property (array of TExpression). Can be used for any general purpose. It is also used to keep the list of parameters of an expression function
  
  * New TMathExpression "Power" operand, example:  'Power(10,2+3)'  (10 elevated to 5)
  
  * New TExpression.AsString function, returns the expression Value as string instead of as variant. This is useful for cases Variants cannot be implicitely converted to string by the RTL, like for example an "array of variant" to string
  
  * New BI.Expression.DateTime.pas unit, contains optimized code to extract parts from a TDateTime (Day, Month, Year, etc) that is faster than SysUtils / DateUtils methods.  This unit is used to speed-up queries and summaries involving datetime group-by or expressions. Also available standalone at:  [FastDateTime](https://github.com/davidberneda/FastDateTime)
  
- Sample Data 

  * New "TechProducts" sample database. A Microsoft Access *.mdb with lots of linked tables and many rows
  
  * Fixed "SampleData\Sqlite_demo" data file to link with the correct "SampleData\Geo" countries database
  
- Importing data

  * Improved importing Microsoft Access table relationships (foreign keys), by looking the internal system table "MSysRelationships". This table is hidden by default, so it needs to be made visible using Access "Permissions" dialog
   
  * Added ODBC driver support for SqlExpress engine
  
  * Added support to import html table cells from html content:
  
  ```delphi
  uses BI.Data.HTML;
  BIGrid1.Data := TBIHtml.Import( Memo1.Lines );
  ```

  * New TDataDefinition component "Links" property, a collection of TDataRelation items to define the "Master" and "Detail" field names that will be linked at import-time after importing all tables. This is design-time equivalent to the optional *.detail file (see for example "SampleData\Sqlite_demo.detail" file)
   
  * New TDataLinksEditor dialog to edit the "Links" collection in TDataManager dialog
  
- Data Filtering

  * New "Reset" method in TFilterItem class, restores filter properties to their default values
  
  * New "Inverted" boolean property in TFilterItem class, to filter the opposite rows (default = False)
  
  * New "Text" property in TFilterItem class, contains properties to easily define a filter for text data:
  
  ```delphi
  uses BI.Expression.Filter;
  var tmp : TTextFilter;
  tmp := BIQuery1.Filter[0].Text;
  tmp.Style := TTextFilterStyle.Contains;
  tmp.Text := 'Hello';
  tmp.CaseSensitive := False;
  
  BIGrid1.Provider := BIQuery1;
  ```
  
  * New TNumericValue "Equal" property (boolean, default = True) to switch between ">" and ">="  (or "<" and "<=")
  
  * Fixed TDateTimeFilter code using Style = "This", "Last" or "Next"  (for example: "Last 5 Months", "This Year", etc)
  
- Firemonkey

  * BIGrid automatic resizing of columns based on maximum length of cells
  
  * BIGrid new "ShowItems" property to automatically display "sub-grids" when the Data property is a multi-table TDataItem. This is equivalent to the already existing VCL BIGrid ShowItems property
  
- Other

  * Removed the mandatory dependency on Indy or System.Net units (in TBIDataset and many other units). Thus, the generic ImportURL function in TBIFileSource has been moved to a new TBIURLSource class:
  
  ```delphi
  uses BI.Web;
  BIGrid1.Data := TBIURLSource.Import( 'http://acme.com/data.csv' );
  ```
  
  * Fixed missing file in beta 14: [TeeBIFMXAbout.fmx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Steema/BI/master/src/delphi/Packages/TeeBIFMXAbout.fmx)
  
  * Fixed using Unicode string fields in TBIDataset and displaying them on grids. TWideStringField is now used instead of TStringField for text data items
  
  * Renamed "TDataManager.EmbedChoose" method to "TDataManager.Embed"
  
  * New FMX and VCL "TUICommon.GotoURL" method, opens the default browser with the specified URL parameter
  
  * Improved file selector dialog in DataManager, now dynamically showing the accepted file extensions in the file type combobox
 
  * New "IndexOf" function at BIQuery Dimensions and Measures collections

## 1st-July-2016 Beta 14

- Expressions

 * New TIfExpression, with Condition, ThenExpression and ElseExpression expression properties. The Condition logical expression is evaluated and the Then or Else values are returned. TIfExpression can be used in any other expressions, and also nested.
 
 * New TObjectExpression, returns the value of any property or field of any TObject. RTTI is used internally to obtain the expression value. 
 
 An example of combining both new expressions by code:

 ```delphi
 // " if Edit1.Text = 'Euro' then 'Iceland' else 'Wales' "
 uses BI.Data.RTTI, BI.Expression;
 Expression:=TIfExpression.Create(
   TLogicalExpression.Create(
     TObjectExpression.From(Edit1,'Text'),
     TLogicalOperand.Equal,
     TTextExpression.Create('Euro')
   ),
   TTextExpression.Create('Iceland'),
   TTextExpression.Create('Wales')
 );
 ```

 * Renamed TTextUnaryExpression to TUnaryTextExpression (for consistency on other "unary" classes)
 
- Data Providers

  * TSingleRecord class (in new unit "BI.Data.SingleRecord") returns a TDataItem with the current row or record of another TDataItem as a table, with all fields in the current record as rows in the new table. 
 
  A new demo showing how to use TSingleRecord is available at this folder:

  demos\vcl\delphi\single_record
  
  * New TBILocalSQL class with methods to import and export a FireDAC "TFDLocalSQL" component from / to a TDataItem
  
- FreePascal / Lazarus

 * Fixes to be able to recompile most of TeeBI units with latest FreePascal 3.0 and Lazarus

- BITree

  * New plugin mechanism allows substituting the "real" Tree control used by BITree to display nodes.
  * New unit "BI.VCL/FMX.Tree.TeeTree" to use TeeTree control as plugin
  * New unit "BI.VCL.Tree.VirtualTreeView" to use VirtualTreeView control as plugin
  
  ```delphi
  // Use TVirtualTreeView inside BITree:
  uses BI.VCL.Tree.VirtualTreeView;
  BITree1.ChangePlugin(TVirtualTreePlugin);
  ```
  
  Changing a BITree plugin can be done at anytime "on-the-fly". All current tree nodes are preserved and re-added to the new underlying control.
  
- BIGrid

  * VCL only: new Grid menu items to display a "Detail" grid for all TDataItem tables that are associated to the current Grid data (the master). When a Detail grid is displayed, changing the main grid row refreshes the detail rows in the detail grid
  

- Miscellaneous

  * TStringDynArray type has been replaced with a custom TStringArray everywhere, for FreePascal compatibility
  * Dashboards: Big refactoring of all TDashboard related units, not yet finalized
  * New Apache web server experimental support for BIWeb (project at: "server\apache\vcl" folder)
  * 40% speed improvement for TInt32Array and TInt64Array Sort method (inlined "swap")
  * Fixed importing CSV content with " " (space) consecutive delimiters (automatic recognition)
  * Renamed TBIExport "ToMemTable" function to "From" for better naming (and future features)
  * New TDataDefinition options and editor to include or not importing Database System tables and Views
  * Several refactorings to reduce code complexity metrics and increment speed
  * New AboutBox dialog for TeeBI FireMonkey components, accessible at design-time

## 10th-June-2016 Beta 13

- Installer

  * Improved detection of TeeChart version (Lite or Pro) for the currently selected IDE, to recompile the TeeBI chart-related packages using the appropiate version
  
- BIGrid (VCL only)

  * New "Detail" menu item displays a secondary grid with the rows that belong to the selected main grid row
  * The "ShowItems" property has been changed from a Boolean to an enumerated type with "Automatic", "Yes" and "No" values
  
- BIWeb server

  * Unit BI.Web.Common.pas is now "agnostic" and can be used with any HTTP server components. The default BIWeb server projects for VCL and Firemonkey use Indy's HTTP components. A new project at "Server\IIS\VCL" folder compiles an ISAPI dll plugin for Microsoft Windows IIS ("Internet Information Server")
  
- BI Arrays

  * Improved speed when calling the array DataMap types "Find" method
  * New generic TArrayReverse method inverts all elements of any array
  * All TXXXArray types have now a new "Reverse" method to invert themselves
  * New SortedFind function in all TXXXArray types, uses a binary search algorithm to quickly find elements when the array is sorted

- BIFilter

  * New TBIFilter class enables design-time filtering of queries and pivot-tables. BIFilter includes an Items collection, each item with specific properties to filter data elements (with different settings depending the data kind, numeric, date-time, text or boolean)
  
- BIQuery

  * Huge refactoring of the TBIQuery class. Working with queries and pivot-tables at design-time without programming has been greatly improved
  * The old "Items" property has been now split into "Dimensions" and "Measures" to avoid redundancy at Object Inspector properties
  * New Filter and Sort properties with a collection of Items, each one with specific properties to customize filtering and sorting, and with custom editor dialogs available both at design and run-time
  * Most select queries and pivot-table summary examples can now be created at design-time, without programming and without typing any SQL text script or text expression
  
- Data Providers

  * Fixed and improved the BDE (Borland Database Engine) data provider. Using the BI.Data.DB.BDE unit allows importing BDE TDatabase, TTable and TQuery components
  * New HeaderCount in TBIExcel component and fixed bug when importing Excel spreadsheets not detecting a header row automatically
  
- Map-Reduce

  * New BI.MapReduce unit includes a generic class with methods to perform the "Map-Reduce" algorithm from TDataItem data. A new demo in "demos\VCL\MapReduce" folder shows the different capabilities
  
- Miscellaneous

  * A new unit "BI.Data.Expressions" now contains a big portion of code that was previously in BI.Data unit. This reduces BI.Data code size and separates concepts.
  * Removed mandatory dependency on FireDAC units (for XE6 and up) when using the Data Manager editor dialogs
  * New BI.Data.Info unit now contains classes that were before in BI.Data unit (TDataInfo and the new TDataItemsInfo)
  * New methods in TDataItems class: Reverse and SortByName
  * Fixed bug in *.hpp C++ autogenerated headers (TDataItem overload "Item" indexed properties)
  * Improved parsing and generation of SQL scripts from / to BI Queries
  * New TDataCursorItem "Name" property to replace the selected item names in queries (the "as ..." SQL clause)
  * New TStores "Count" function, returns the number of registered TStore items
  * New TBIRegistry class variables "UseRegistry" (boolean, default True) and "IniFile" (string), enable using an *.ini file instead of the machine Registry. This is necessary for BIWeb server in ISAPI DLL mode
  * TSummary "DateOptions.Part" property has been renamed to simply "DatePart"
  * Improved performance at TSummaryTotals class, and fixed working with date-time special kinds of data (Month, Quarter and Weekday names)
  * FTP import class now uses the connection Timeout setting specified in its TDataDefinition
  * New Firemonkey editor dialog for TBIGrid control
  * BIComposer TGroupChart inner class now using TBIChart control instead of a normal TChart
  * New Component Icon images for IDE design-time component palette

- BI.VCL.Chart.Functions -> BI.VCL.ChartFunctions
- BI.FMX.Chart.Functions -> BI.FMX.ChartFunctions

- These units have been renamed to workaround a compiler issue that was generating an error: "Bad packaged unit format".
Having this problem fixed, TeeBI will soon provide all the available TeeChart "Function" classes as a simple providers of TDataItem (ie, calculating a Moving Average at design-time without coding, without the need of using a TChart)

- Renamed methods:

TBIDataSetSource 
  AddItemField -> Add
  AddItemFields -> Add

  FieldOfData -> FieldOf
  FromDataSet -> From
  FromField -> From

- New method:

TBIDataSetSource.From to import an array of TField, and to import all datasets in a TCustomConnection.

- BDE "Borland Database Engine"

Fixed and improved support to import data using the BDE, in the same way it is done with FireDAC for other database engines.
Supported components are: TDatabase, TTable and TQuery

- New TDataInfo.GetMinMax class procedure to obtain the minimum and maximum value of all data in a TDataItem that is numeric (integer, single, etc) or datetime.

- New BI.Expression TDateTimeSpan enumeration type, used by Dynamic Filter and in future Expression classes involving calculating "span" of datetime values.

- Fixed persistence issue when loading data with "map" values in TeeBI binary format.

- Fixed problem with Data Selector dialog at design-time, it was showing all forms and components belonging to the IDE instead of just the forms in the active project.

- Improvements in Dynamic Filter editor dialog (VCL), adding specific controls to filter numeric, text and boolean data types.

- New BI.Expression.Filter unit contains a preliminary version of TFilterItem class, that will be soon used by Dynamic Filter editor.
This class enables data filtering with simple properties instead of having to write and pass expressions in string format, like for example:

`MyFilter.Data:=MyDateTimeField;
MyFilter.DateTime.Style := Last;
MyFilter.DateTime.Period := TDateTimeSpan.Month;`

- Multiple filter objects can then be used together as for example the "where" clause of BIQuery components and many other uses.


## 23th-May-2016  Beta 11 Hotfix 1 and 2

- Fixed BIChart compilation errors when using TeeChart Lite / Standard version instead of Pro version

## 20th-May-2016  Beta 11

- **RAD Studio 10.1 Berlin**

  Added TeeBI support for 10.1 Berlin release.
  
  Also working TeeBI controls with new "FireUI Live Preview" app in Berlin:
  
  ![](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/Studio10_1_Berlin_TeeBI_FireUI_Live_Preview.png)
  
  For more information about integrating TeeBI and TeeChart with Live Preview, click here:
  
  [Berlin FireUI Live Preview and TeeBI, TeeChart](https://steema.com/wp/blog/2016/04/19/rad-studio-10-1-berlin-add-teechart-to-fireui-live-preview/)
  
- **New basic demo**

  A small new test project describes how to create TDataItem objects in different modes by code:
  
  [Creating TDataItem manually](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/vcl/Manual_Data)
  
  
- **Pivot-Tables**

  New BIQuery component to create select queries, summaries and pivot-tables at both design and run-time.
  Editor dialog enables drag-drop of data item fields and output preview.
  
  ![](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/TeeBI_Pivot_Query_Editor.png)
  
- **BIChart improvements**

  A complete refactoring of the BIChart control provides a new Options property with several settings to create charts from any kind of data structure and content in a smart way.
  
  The automatic decisions done by BIChart have been summarized here:
  
  [BIChart logic](https://plus.google.com/+DavidBerneda/posts/T6jVGbcFyak)
  
  ![](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/TeeBI_Chart_Design_Time.png)
  
- **Dynamic Filter**

  New class and editor dialog to enable visual building of filter "expressions" by checking / unchecking items on a tree view.
  Linked data tables are automatically included in the tree, together with its individual items.
  The BIQuery editor includes this new Dynamic Filter editor to define the query "where" clause.
  
  ![](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/TeeBI_Dynamic_Filter.png)
  
- **Dashboards**

  New TDashboard Layout property to customize the arrangement of dashboard panels inside a BIVisual control.
  Predefined layouts are included in TLayouts.Predefined property.
  
- **Component Importing**

  New TComponentImporter class and editor dialog to "link" any BI control (BIGrid, BIChart etc) and BI components (BIQuery, etc) with any supported  Component living on any accessible Form or DataModule.
  
  The edit dialog shows the available supported components and VCL/FMX controls, and selecting them creates an internal TDataItem and imports the component content into it automatically.
  
  For example, text from Memo controls (in csv,json,xml,etc) , any TDataset-derived component, ListBoxes, TXXConnection components are recognized and made available.
  
  Importing data from components is done transparent and at fast speed, so the BI controls receiving the output just get normal TDataItem(s) as if they were already imported and persisted from a TStore or by code.
  
  ![](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/TeeBI_Component_design-time.png)
  

- **Data Selector**

  New dialog that includes both the already existing data selector tree, and the new Component selector dialog.
  This dialog is now the default editor for design-time choosing of all components "Data" property.
  
  A new form has been added to the Import example project, using the new TComponentImport feature:
  
  [Import Components Example Project](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/vcl/Import)
  
- **Importing from configuration**

  The TDataDefinition class (used by the "Data Manager" dialog) is now a TComponent that can be used at design-time to define which data to import in several modes and settings, without needing to persist the import output to disk.
  
  This component is also a "provider" of data so it can be connected at design-time to any other BI control or BIQuery to perform disk-less queries on its data.
  
- **Provider events**

  Many classes and components issue internal events when data is changed or destroyed.
  
  Other components and controls (BIGrid, BIChart, etc) get notified of these events to refresh its output or make sure there are no memory leaks. This mechanism works at design-time too, so changes are refreshed automatically.
  
- **RTTI and ORM**

  Important improvement in BI.Data.RTTI unit.
  
  TTypeProvider class has been changed quite a lot to better support different types of data like dynamic arrays and TCollection objects.
  
  It also includes new Count and Delete methods, and a new Items[Index] default array property to access its elements.
  
  New example available, showing how to use TeeBI in ORM mode with your own data:
  
  [TeeBI and ORM Example Project](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/vcl/ORM_RTTI)
  
  
- **BI Arrays**

  Improved all the Array classes with a new Copy method that can optionally copy a subset of the array based on an index parameter.
  The "index" is just a TInt32Array containing the positions of the items to copy.
  
  These methods are also internally used to fix the issue of creating a "Map" of the array items considering only the non-null values.
  TDataItem is now passing its "Missing" index array when creating the DataMap property.
  
- **TDataset**

  New FromField class method to import just a single TField instead of the whole TDataset.
  
- **TDataItem**

  The base and most important class in TeeBI (TDataItem) has new features:
  
  - New LoadFromFile method (SaveToFile already existed)
  - New Clear method to remove all data and destroy all sub-items
  - New ClearData method to just remove all data without changing the structure or sub-items
  
- **Expressions**

  - All TExpression classes now include an Assign method. 
  
  This has enabled a new TExpression.Clone method that is capable of duplicating an expression tree to return an identical one, recursively.

- **BI Web Server**

  - Improved the automatic re-import of data using an "scheduler" configuration.
  
  Each data can be configured to be re-imported at specific intervals (ie: "Every Day")
  
  This feature enables web-replication of databases from one BIWeb server to another. 
  
  That is, for example BIWeb server 1 re-imports an SQL Server database every 10 minutes, while other BIWeb servers 2 and 3 also do re-import that data from BIWeb server 1, just this time the data is already converted to ultra-fast binary TeeBI format so the transmission via web is much improved (with BIWeb zip compression).
  
  There is no limit on how many BIWeb servers access data from other BIWeb servers.
  
- **Fixes**

  - Fixed bug at TBIExcel class, when importing Excel spreadsheets with non-English US decimal settings ("," <-> ".")
  - Fixed bug at TBIJsonExport class, content with forbidden (non-valid json) characters are "escaped" 
  - Adding or removing Data.Items now correctly change their Parent property
  - Fixed potential access violation when closing the RAD Studio IDE in Seattle 10.0
  
- **Miscellaneous**

  - New TDataItems Insert method
  - New TDataCursor and TSummary UseFilter boolean property (to use or not the Filter property)
  - New summary THistogram feature to distribute aggregations by text fields (in groups: ABC..DEF..GHI...JKL etc)
  - BI.Summary.Totals unit: TSummaryTotals class is now a TComponent that can be used in queries and any other BI control
  - New TDataColorizer AlphaColorOf( double ), returns the color in palette that corresponds to the double parameter
  - New TDataKindConvert method to change a TDataItem from one Kind to another, previously verifying no data will be lost
  
  
  
## 1st-April-2016  Beta 10

- **Dashboards**

  ![](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/TeeBI_Dashboard_VCL_Small.png)

  New units and a new [TBIVisual](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/BI.Dashboard.pas) component to create visual dashboards.  *Note: Preview Alpha Release*
  
  Dashboards provide a way to create complex multi-panel layouts of grids, charts and other controls using a "template".
  
  The template is just a TDataItem which can be imported for example from a JSON string.
  
  Templates can be rendered in VCL, Firemonkey and also as [HTML Web pages](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/BI.Dashboard.HTML.pas).
  
  Templates contain named definitions of data (queries, summaries, custom data, external files, etc) and then panels can optionally use these data and specify the render style (grid, chart, listbox, text, etc) for each panel independently.
  
  Templates can also contain "layout" definitions. Layouts can be organized [nesting predefined layouts](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/TeeBI_Nested_Dashboard_Layouts.png) to create complex visualizations.
  
  Finally, templates define "dashboards" that consist of a group of "panels" with an optionally specified layout.
  
  TBIVisual can then generate a template using its Render property, which can be a VCL / Firemonkey render, or an HTML Web render component to output web pages.
  
  Interactivity between panels is controlled by using "variables" defined in the template. Variables can be used as parameters everywhere in the template, for example to filter sql "where" clauses or any other purpose.
  
  For example, clicking a listbox panel can refresh other panels that depend on the current listbox selected item, for example grids and charts that are displaying data using SQL queries using the variables as parameters in the query.
  
  *Note: No demo for dashboards is provided yet. It'll be uploaded soon*
  
  New Dashboard Units:
  
    * BI.Dashboard
    * BI.Dashboard.HTML
    * BI.VCL.Dashboard
    * BI.FMX.Dashboard
    * BI.VCL.Dashboard.Chart
    * BI.FMX.Dashboard.Chart
    
    
- **Demos**

  A new example has been added to both GitHub repository and TeeBI installer:
  
  * [Expressions](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/firemonkey/Expressions) Tests and benchmarks to TExpression class (base class to parse and evaluate expressions).
  
- **BIWeb Server**
 
  Several improvements and fixes in BIWeb server, including the capability of returning HTML dashboards from templates as URL parameter.

  BIWeb can now be used to provide static files under a "public" subfolder structure (folder location is customizable)
  
- **HTML Export**

  * TBIHtmlExport class can now generate "colorized" HTML tables from TDataItem data, using the new Colorizers property.
  
  In addition, TDataColorizers has a new method "TryColorize" that is used also by TBIGrid VCL control to [colorize cells](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/bigrid_colorizer.png).

  
- **JSON Import**

  * Improved conversion of JSON types. 
    When JSON content includes sub-objects of different types (for example, strings and floats), TBIJSON component now detects this situation and "upgrades" types to their best common type.

  * New Hierarchical mode
  
    The default mode of importing JSON content is to try to "flatten" all objects and sub-objects into a single "table" containing all columns that appear in the JSON source, filling Missing (null) cells when no values exist.

    The new Hierarchical property can be set to True to change this import behaviour, where the JSON structure is returned as a "tree" TDataItem structure that reflects the original JSON content, instead of a "flat" table.  
    Each JSON value is returned as a TDataItem following the parent-child of the source. 
    This means JSON arrays are returned also as a TDataItem with all Items being TDataItem objects too.
    
    *Example:*
    
    `var JSON : TBIJSON;
    JSON := TBIJSON.Create;
    JSON.Hierarchical := True;
    Data := JSON.ImportText( AString );`

- **TDataMerge**

  New TDataMerge class (at BI.Data.Merge unit) creates and returns a TDataItem from a list of data items that have the same structure.
  Structure compatibility (data items Kind) is recursively checked before doing the merge.
  
  `Data := TDataMerge.FromDatas( [ One, Two, Three ] );`
  
  TDataMerge SameStructure function is also useful in itself, as it returns if two or more data items are compatible or not.
  
  
- **TBISQL**

  Improvements in both SQL parsing and SQL ToString generation from queries and summaries.
  "select .. from select" and other nested combinations ("select" in expressions) are now better handled.
  
  TDataSelect and TSummary classes ToString method now returns its equivalent SQL representation.

- **Expressions**

  New TDateExpression and TTimeExpression classes, to return just the date or the time of the source expression respectively.
  
  `ShowMessage( TExpression.Evaluate( 'Date("5/6/2016")' ).ToString )`

- **FTP Support**

  Importing data from FTP server is now possible, setting the FTP [server and username properties](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/TeeBI_FTP_import.png) in the Data Manager dialog.
  Files are transferred from the specified server folder and imported into a TDataItem structure.
  Each file is tested to determine its content (CSV, JSON etc) and imported using the appropiate import class.
  
- **TBIChart**

  New support for [Financial Charts](https://raw.github.com/Steema/BI/master/docs/img/TeeBI_Quandl_multistock.png) (Candle Series) for VCL, FMX and also HTML dashboards (using TeeChart.js HTML5).
  
- **TBIComposer**

  Existing TBIVisualizer control in beta 9 has been renamed to TBIComposer.
  The plan is to convert this control to a dashboard template, thus allowing nesting multiple "composers" inside any dashboard panel, and also reducing the quantity of code.  
  Dashboards are much more powerful than TBIVisualizer and functionality is somewhat overlapped.
  
- **TBIControlTree**

  Mostly for debugging purposes, VCL TBIControlTree editor has been improved and also ported to Firemonkey.
  
  `uses BI.VCL.Editor.ControlTree;
  TBIControlTree.Edit( Self, MyControl );`
  
  This dialog is useful to display the inner internals of TBIVisual dashboard controls.
  
- **Other changes**

  * Types TFMXCommon and TVCLCommon have been renamed to TUICommon (same name for both)
  * New TTextArray IndexOf method overload with a new CaseSensitive boolean parameter
  * TDataItem Count property is now read-only. Use Data.Resize (or protected cast) to change Count.
  * New TBIHTMLHelper Color method, returns a TColor in HTML format (#bbggrr)
  * New TDataItems Exists function, equivalent shortcut to `Find( 'foo' ) <> nil`
  * New TDataItems IndexOf function, returns the data item that has AName string parameter
  * New TBISource FromDatas function, returns a single TDataItem from an array of TDataItems
  * New FromURL function in several file import formats (CSV, JSON, XML etc)
  * Fixed TDataSelect queries returning rows from sub-sub-tables (more than one depth level)
  * New TGroupBy IndexOf and Remove methods (for TSummary.By property)
  * New TDataViewer Embedd method for Firemonkey (to insert a data viewer form inside another form)

## 29-Feb-2016  Beta 9

- **Demos**

  New examples have been added to both GitHub repository and TeeBI installer:
  
  * [BIDataSet_Speed](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/vcl/BIDataSet_Speed) speed comparison between standard TDataset (TFDMemTable) and TBIDataSet
  
  * [Export](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/vcl/Export) example to show the different formats to output a TeeBI TDataItem (Csv, Html, JSON, Xml, Excel, PDF)
  
  * [Grid](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/vcl/Grid) example to show all possibilities of TBIGrid control (grouping, sorting, filtering and searching)
  
  * [Master-Detail](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/vcl/Master-Detail) demo displays two BIGrid controls with master-detail linked TBIDatasets
  
  * [Speed](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/vcl/Speed) demo is a benchmark of several TeeBI features (adding, deleting records, queries, saving, loading, etc)
  
  * [Online BIWeb](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/online/remote_web) adds a new example to obtain a live HTML5 Javascript chart from BIWeb server
  
- **IDE Help**

  * A compiled TeeBI API reference help file in CHM format has been included.
  This file is a mirror or TeeBI API [online html documentation](http://docs.steebi.com/vclfmx/docs/Docs/API_Reference/Doc/Html/)
  
- **BIWeb server**

  * More information (data size and modified time) is returned when requesting a list of all available data sources:
  
     http://steema.cat:15015/?data&format=.htm
     
  * Logs are now optionally persisted under a customizable ".\Logs" folder.
  Data in BIWeb logs is saved in standard binary TDataItem format, so they can be loaded, queried and analyzed like as any other TDataItem data.
  
  * Public folders can be optionally enabled to use BIWeb server as a file provider (for any kind of file).
  The "root" public folder is named ".\Public" default.
  
  For example, a picture is available under .\public\img folder at Steema's BIWeb server:
  
  http://steema.cat:15015/img/summary_links.png
  
  * Live HTML5 Javascript charts are now returned by BIWeb server, just specifying ".html5" as the requested format in the URL.
  For example: [this link](http://steema.cat:15015/?data=SQLite_demo|%22Order%20Details%22&format=.html5&summary=sum(Quantity);Shippers.ShipperID) returns a summary query as a live chart.
  
  * Grand Totals is a new experimental feature to return totalizers for numeric columns, by adding the "totals=xxx" parameter in the URL, being "xxx" the requested aggregator (for example "sum" or "count")
  
  [Totals Example, last row is the grand total sum](http://steema.cat:15015/?data=SQLite_demo|%22Order%20Details%22&format=.htm&summary=sum(Quantity);Categories.CategoryName&totals=sum)
  
- **TBIGrid**

  Several new features in TBIGrid (VCL only for most of them) to improve the display of TDataItem data objects.
  
  * New local grid menu, accessible by clicking the top-left most grid cell. This menu is optional and offers menu items to control the following features:
  
  * "Alternate" property to paint grid row backgrounds in alternate colors
  
  * "Filters" property to display a top row of edit boxes and combo boxes, one for each grid column, to enable filtering grid rows that match the typed characters.
  
  * Grouping: A grid column can be used to group data based on distinct values of the selected column.
  When grouping, a secondary grid appears side to the main grid with the list of values. Selecting a row filters and displays the data rows that belong to the selected group value. For example show Customers group by Country, filters Customers for each Country.
  
  * "RowNumbers" property to display the row IDs numbers as an extra grid column
  
  * "Search" property to display an edit box to enable highlighting grid cells that match the typed text.
  
  * New "OnDataChange" event that is called whenever the grid is refreshed after filtering or grouping.
  
- **BI.Arrays**

  * For 32bit applications only, all array index access has been converted to use 32bit Integer instead of 64bit.
  (Use of 64bit Integer was not necessary and not optimized for 32bit)
  
  * Added missing "Insert" method for TBooleanArray and TTextArray types.
  
- **HTML Exporting**

  * New FloatFormat property to customize the html output of float values (default is "0.##")
  
- **BI.Data.PDF**

  * Several improvements for better text positioning and more accurate calculation of total PDF pages for large documents, when displaying the "page N of M" annotations.
  
- **BI.Data**

  * New MissingCount function in TMissingData class returns the number of items that are Missing (null)
  
  ```ShowMessage('There are '+IntToStr( MyData.Missing.MissingCount )+' missing items in '+MyData.Name)```
  
  * New Insert method at TDataItem adds a new empty "row" at the specified Index position. It also recursively inserts a new row in sub-tables if they exist.
  
  ```MyData.Insert( 10 )  // adds a new row at position 10 (count starts at zero)```
  
  * Several public fields have been converted to read-only properties to prevent unintented modification.
  
- **BI.Data.Search**

  * New Index property in TDataSearch class enables searching or filtering values from a subset of the total data rows.
  The Index array determines the row IDs to consider when searching or filtering.
  
- **TSQLParser**

  * Parsing SQL now returns TDataItem instances that contain the SQL query as a "Provider" object.
  This means the SQL query is not automatically executed at the time the SQL is parsed, but it will be executed in delay-mode, the first time data is necessary (accessed via LoadData).
  
- **TBIDataSet**

  * New RowNumbers boolean property (default is False), when True the dataset adds a new colum with the effective Row numbers.
  This might be useful to show the row IDs when the dataset is filtered or sorted, where IDs would not be a sequence.
  
  * Editing support
  
  BIDataSet now supports the standard inserting, deleting and modificating mechanism that can be used by code (BIDataSet.Insert, etc) or by manually editing cells on a DBGrid or BIGrid control.
  
- **TDateTimePartExpression**

  * New "DecadeOfYear" enum to return the decade part of a TDateTime (from 1 to 10)

- **Multi-CPU / Multi-Thread support**

  * Initial support for multi-thread (parallel CPU) operations using TDataItem datas.
  Queries can be executed in parallel, for example using System.Thread TParallel.For loops, Futures or Tasks.
  
- **TBIChart**

  * New Fill overload method to pass a TDataCursor object. This enables creating a chart with only the subset of data rows specified in the Cursor Index, and with the optional Cursor sorting.
  
- New TDataMapAsData parameters to optionally return the map values sorted.

- Miscellaneous fixes and speed improvements, specially at Logical and Arithmetic BI Expression classes.
  

  
## 12-Feb-2016  Beta 8

- Installation

  * A new checkbox at TeeBIRecompile.exe installer tool determines if TeeBI packages will be recompiled using TeeChart (any version, Lite or Pro)
  
- TDataSearch

  * New class to perform data search on any TDataItem.
    
    It returns the array of row indices with search matches and also the array of individual "cell hits".

    The [Data Search demo](https://github.com/Steema/BI/tree/master/demos/delphi/vcl/Search) shows how to use it to filter and/or highlight grid cells.
    
    Several properties control case-sensitive text, partial matches and if the search is performed using a background thread to not block typing in the search box when searching in huge data quantities (millions of cells).
    
    ```delphi
    uses BI.Data.Search;
    var Search : TDataSearch;
        Search.Source := MyData;
        BIDataset1.PrepareIndex( Search.Find('Hello') );
    ```

- PDF Exporting

  * New TBIPDFExport class generates a PDF file or stream from a TDataItem.
  
    Several properties can be used to define PDF font styles, headers, footers and page numbering.
    Note: PDF exporting uses the TPDFCanvas class which is available in TeeChart version Pro only.


    ```delphi
    uses BI.VCL.PDF;  // or BI.FMX.PDF for Firemonkey
    TBIPDFExport.SaveToFile( MyData, 'test.pdf' );
    ```

- BIWeb server

  * Data can be returned in PDF format using ".pdf" in the URL request:
 
    http://steema.cat:15015/?data=SQLite_demo|Customers&format=.pdf
  
- BI.Arrays
 
  * Speed optimizations and a new overload Copy method in all array classes
 
- TDataItem

  * New optional parameter "Count" at Delete method to delete multiples rows
  
- Database

  * Support for FireDAC "ADS" (Advantadge Database Server) driver
  * TBIDB.ImportFile now supports Microsoft Access (*.mdb and *.accdb) database files
  * New TBIDataset PrepareIndex method, enables setting the array of row indices that BIDataset uses to filter records
  
- Queries and SQL

  * New support for "offset" SQL clause, to specify the first row to return after the query is finished. Default "offset" is zero.
  * More combinations of queries supported (queries from summaries with TDataItem complex structures)
  * Big speed optimization, data items are directly copied (cloned) when possible, instead of looping all rows
  
- XML

  * New TBIXML ExcludeNodes property
  
    Defines the node <tags> in the source xml content that should be excluded from importing.

  * Fixed bug when importing nested master-detail xml tags (sub-tags)

- Microsoft Excel

  * New tab at Data Manager dialog enabled specifying the number of rows of an Excel spreadsheet that will be used as the "header" of the imported columns.  This option corresponds to TBIExcel.HeaderCount property
  
- Expressions

  * New TDateTimeExpression Date and Time properties, return only the current date or current time, and not both
  
- Additional

  * New TStores.Exist function, returns True if a given store is registered
  * New TBIREngine Version property returns the "R Language" engine version
  * Several fixes in BI.Data.CSV import class
  * Fixed saving a multi-line SQL string in the Data Manager dialog
  * Fixed in the TBISQL parser
  * Fix for TSummary queries that involve datetime expressions using "Decade"
  * Fix when renaming a data item at the Data Manager dialog, renames its associated folder if it exists
  * Several fixes for FreePascal / Lazarus
  

## 27-Jan-2016  Beta 7

- Algorithms
  * Native access to R Language (32bit and 64bit) using [opaR library](https://github.com/SigmaSciences/opaR)
  
    The new [BI.Plugins.R.opaR](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/Algorithms/BI.Plugins.R.opaR.pas) unit contains the code that uses opaR library.

  * New VCL and FMX forms for "Console" interactive R calls.
    
    These forms interact with R to call any R method or obtain R variables.

    The console can be easily embedded in your projects:

   ```pascal
    uses BI.VCL.RConsole, BI.VCL.Grid;
      var R : TBIRConsole; 
        R:= TBIRConsole.Create(Self);
        TVCLCommon.AddForm(R, MyPanel); // "MyPanel" can be any parent control
        TBIREngine.Engine.Output:= R.Memo.Lines;
    ```
  
  * Instructions to setup TeeBI for machine-learning [click here](https://github.com/Steema/BI/wiki/Installing-R-and-Python)

- Summary
 
 * New [TSummaryTotals](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/BI.Summary.Totals.pas) class to calculate summary subtotals and grand-totals.
 
   ```pascal
   uses BI.Summary.Totals;
   BIGrid1.Data:= TDataItem.Create( TSummaryTotals.Create( MySummary ));
   ```

 * New class function TSummaryItem.GuessType
 
   Returns if a TDataItem can be used as a summary "Measure", "Group", or "Both".

   This is useful to create summaries without knowing the kind of data (integers, text, etc)

   ```pascal
   uses BI.Summary;
   if TSummaryItem.GuessType( MyData[2] ) <> TSummaryItemType.GroupBy then 
      MySummary.AddMeasure( MyData[2], TAggregate.Sum );
   ```
 
- Queries

 * New [TBISQL](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/BI.Data.SQL.pas) class function to convert a summary or query from / to SQL language.
 
   ```pascal
   // Note: Only a subset of SQL "select" clause is supported.
   uses BI.Data.SQL;
   Memo1.Text:= TBISQL.From( MySummary ); 
   
   var MyData : TDataItem;
   MyData:= TBISQL.From( Data, Memo1.Text);  // "Data" contains items referred in text
   ```   
      
 
- Importing Objects (ORM using RTTI)

 The new [BI.Data.RTTI](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/BI.Data.RTTI.pas) unit contains a generic class to import any Record or TObject instance (or a TList of Array etc) into a TDataItem.
 
 ```pascal
 uses BI.Data.RTTI;
 var D : TDataItem; 
 D:= TDataItem.Create( TTypeProvider<TCustomer>.Create( MyCustomers ));
 
 // "MyCustomers" can be an "array of TCustomer", TList<TCustomer>, etc
 ```
 
 The TTypeProvider class has methods to Add, Find, Remove and Update items, so its basically mapping a TDataItem and its children Items with your custom record or class fields.
 
 
 
- BIWeb server
  * Remote query execution
 
    Adding the "sql=select * from customers..." tag to the [TBIWebClient](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/BI.Web.pas) URL request.

    [Live Example](http://steema.cat:15015/?data=SQLite_demo&format=.htm&sql=select * from Customers where City="Madrid")

  * Remote query by code
  
  ```pascal
  BIGrid1.Data:= TBIWebClient.Query('Steema','SQLite_Demo','select * from Customers where City="Madrid"');
  ```

  
- Data Filtering
  * New "IsNull" embedded function to use it in filters to skip or not "missing" null data.
  
  ```pascal
var Query : TDataSelect;
begin
  Query:=TDataSelect.Create;
  Query.Add(Demo['Orders']);
  Query.Filter:=TDataFilter.FromString(Demo,'(not IsNull(Orders.Date)) and (Customers.Name="intel")');

  result:=TDataItem.Create(Query);  // <-- Set Query as Provider for result
end;
  ```
  
- Data Provider

  * A new class TDataProvider enables automatic nested TDataItem data loading.
  
   For example, a TDataItem might be filled with data that is the output result of a query, which in turn is using other TDataItem datas that might have also a Provider (recursively).

  This mechanism has been added to queries, summaries and other classes that are now capable of doing "select ... from select ..." nested queries.  Other classes also have been refactored to be "Providers" of data, like the class that handles remote Web requests of TDataItem data streams.
  
  With this new change, its no longer necessary to "calculate" queries or summaries. Simply construct a TDataItem passing a Provider parameter, and the summary or query will be automatically calculated "just-in-time" when its necessary:
  
  ```pascal
  BIGrid1.Data:= TDataItem.Create( MyQuery );
  ```
  
- Lazarus and FreePascal
  * Fixes and improvements to support TeeBI with Lazarus and FreePascal
  
    TeeBI can be used in Lazarus 1.7 (FreePascal 3.0) under Windows and Linux.

    The [BI.FPC](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/BI.FPC.pas) unit contains several helper methods internally used to avoid adding "$IFDEF" in other units.

    Note: Lazarus TDataset field does not support nested "ADT" dataset fields.

  * Support for importing database data with Lazarus
 
    The new [BI.Data.SqlDB](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/BI.Data.SqlDB.pas) unit plugs with Lazarus SqlDB engine and all of its supported database formats.

    (Firebird, Interbase, Oracle, Postgres, ODBC, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL)


- New in [BI.Arrays](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/BI.Arrays.pas) unit 
  * New helper method "Append" for all TxxxArray classes to append another array into it.

- Data Comparison
  * The [TDataCompare](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/BI.Compare.pas) class has been improved alot. It can be used to test if two TDataItem instances are equal or not (in both structure and data), and optionally obtain the differences in an output TDataItem.
  
  ```pascal
  uses BI.Compare;
  var Diff : TDataItem;
  if not TDataCompare.Same( MyData1, MyData2, Diff) then
     BIGrid1.Data:= Diff;
  ```
  
- CSV format
 * Improvements in CSV data import.
 
   Several new features in [TBICSV](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/BI.Data.CSV.pas) class enable importing huge amounts of data at fast speed (1 billion cells in 120 seconds).

   For detailed CSV data import usage, please [follow this link](https://github.com/Steema/BI/wiki/Importing-CSV-data)
   
 
- Other changes and fixes
  * Fixes for XE4 Firemonkey forms
  * BIWeb server project support for XE4, using SQLExpress instead of FireDAC
  * TDataArray new IndexOf method:
    ```pascal
    var D : TDataArray; D:=[ MyData1, MyData2, ...];
    if D.IndexOf('Hello') <> -1 then ...
    ```
    
  * TSortItem new Active (boolean) property, to enable / disable sort order items

  * New [BI.Data.Xml.OXml](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/BI.Data.XML.OXml.pas) unit to support importing Xml data with Oxml. (Also available [Delphi Xml](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/BI.Data.XML.MSXML.pas) and [OmniXml](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/BI.Data.XML.Omni.pas) )
 
  * New OnProgress event in base [TBISource](https://github.com/Steema/BI/blob/master/src/delphi/BI.DataSource.pas) class
 
    Optional OnProgress event is called while data is being imported, enabling cancelling the import.

  * Executables TeeBIRecompile and BIWeb now codesigned using SHA256 secure hash.
